Implementation of Ising model using Metropolis algorithm on the GPU using CUDA. Visualisation done using raylib: https://www.raylib.com/.
#
The simulation doesn't necesserly aim to be the most physically accurate as it will not be used for calculating critical temperature or other properties. It was mostly an exercise, though I might improve it in the future.
